# Advanced-Computer-Vision-with-TensorFlow
This course is part of the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI. https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques

I have uploaded the assignments that I have completed throughout this course.

This Course Covers:

Computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation
Transfer learning to apply pre-trained models to new tasks, customize existing models, and build new ones
Techniques like class activation maps and saliency maps to interpret how models make predictions and improve their design
Building object detection models, including regional-CNN and ResNet-50, to detect, localize, and label rubber duck images
Image segmentation using fully convolutional network (FCN) variations like U-Net and Mask-RCNN to identify and detect objects like numbers, pets, and zombies
Identifying which parts of an image a model uses to make its predictions
Applying ML interpretation methods to inspect and improve the design of AlexNet, a famous network
Practical skills and knowledge for working with image data and developing intelligent systems that can recognize and understand visual information.
